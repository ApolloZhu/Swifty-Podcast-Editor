AR Lipstick (1513554034), while still in beta through Public TestFlight (IL5MiSG6), is the next app I plan to release to the App Store. This app utilizes ARKit face tracking to extract features of your face, identifies which regions are of your mouth, and applies virtual “lipstick” for you. You can choose from many lipsticks curated by the open-source community, and see how they look on you. And I want to support users who only have older devices without any TrueDepth camera, the project fallbacks to other machine learning frameworks like Vision for a less optimum, but working alternative solution.

As I always do, I released the source code of my program on GitHub for others to learn and use as the foundation of their innovations. Recently, a stranger in the community approached me for help as they are trying to integrate my code into their project. From their suggestion, I will be adding support for lipsticks with sparkles (such as TOM FORD DAZED) and more.

But why did I wrote it in the first place? Certainly, it’s an interesting application of computer vision and is used in commercial applications to allow customers to try out products before they buy. However, I think the more important reason that drove me to start this project is the people it empowers. Owning a lipstick as a biological male in real life might sometimes bring harsh words from even those intimate ones, but a virtual lipstick on your phone? You now have the freedom to be, and express yourself.

Indeed, apps are for everyone, and people find this app interesting in general. For I “graduated” from a legal minor, I’m now using my own developer account, which caused the old TestFlight link to expire. My friend constantly reminded/urged me to update my TestFlight build. And as I’m writing this essay now, another friend from back in elementary school messaged me on WeChat. “谢谢你开发的软件哈哈哈哈哈哈，效果很 OK (thank you for developing this app, worked liked a charm)”, she said. I couldn’t be more excited. On the one hand, receiving praise for your work is satisfying, but again achieving my goal of writing software that people find useful, on the other hand, is the real reason why I jumped off my bed and shared with my family this unexpected message.

Apps sure have the power to bring joy to everyone--even to developers themselves!
